# StableGAN

## Overview

StableGAN is a novel approach designed to stabilize the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and prevent mode collapse. This method introduces a relative performance score (RPS) and adaptive training scheduling for both the generator and discriminator networks.

### Key Features:
- Relative Performance Measure: Implements a relative performance score to monitor and adjust the training process based on the performance of both the generator and discriminator.
- Adaptive Training Scheduling: Adapts the training schedule dynamically by reallocating more iterations to the underperforming network to ensure balanced learning and mitigate mode collapse.
- Versatile Architecture Support: Tested across various GAN architectures to validate the effectiveness of the approach.
